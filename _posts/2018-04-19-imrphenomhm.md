title: First Higher-Multipole Model of Gravitational Waves from Spinning and Coalescing Black-Hole Binaries
excerpt: >-
  Gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes currently rely on theoretical models that predict the dominant multipoles (l,m) of the radiation during inspiral, merger and ringdown. We introduce a simple method to include the subdominant multipoles to binary black hole gravitational waveforms, given a frequency-domain model for the dominant multipoles.
