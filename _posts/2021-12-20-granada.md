Above the alicatado Ibn Zamrak praise the conquer of Algeciras by Muhammad V:
<center>"A espada y a fuerza en Algeciras<br/>
  entraste, abriendo puerta antes cerrada,<br/>
  tras veinte otros castillos, y a tu tropa<br/>
  de botín cuanto había repartiste".<br/>
</center><br/>

- Residence for the male children and their professors.


## Sala de la Barca
- Passing the North Portico and right before the Throne Room there is the ***Sala de la Barca***. Named not because the shape of the dome but because of a simplification of the original arabic name al-Baraka meaning "Blessing".
- There was an fire in 1890 that destroyed this roof and the portico's one.
- Towards Throne Room, there is, to the left a door to the upstairs rooms which were the winter sultan's chambers. To the right, there is an oratory with mihrab which is the best one oriented to la Meca in Al-Ándalus.

- Where the Capitulaciones were signed.
- Where the sultan received the ambassadors. The room is very dim, with the sun coming from behind the sultan, such that he could see the visitors but they could not see him.
- This rooms shows the power of the sultan, blessed by god, only after him. There is no place without decoration, it is everywhere as Alá. The polychromy is missing.
- The dome holds an important symbolism. The night sky of the eary muslim expansion, the seven skies to be crossed before reaching God throne, the Paradise, which is the eighth sky. There are also the four life trees coming down from the corner, and the sultan was below as a earthly representation. The dome is composed of 8017 wooden pieces as a giant puzzle of taracea.
- The celosías (lattice) were stained glass windows, but they were destroyed in the explosion of the S. Pedro powder keg in 1590.
- One of the East (right) alcobas lead to Emperor Carlos chambers.
- Nasrid polygons, deformation of a square.
    - The Nasrid Bone
    - The Flying fish
    - MThe olinete
