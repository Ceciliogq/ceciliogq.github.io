title: Adding harmonics to the interpretation of the black hole mergers of GWTC-1
excerpt: >-
  We consider the ten confidently detected gravitational wave signals in the GWTC-1 catalog which are consistent with mergers of binary black hole systems, and re-analyze them with waveform models that contain subdominant spherical harmonic modes. This analysis is based on the current (fourth) generation of the IMRPhenom family of phenomenological waveform models, which consists of the IMRPhenomX frequency-domain models and the IMRPhenomT time-domain models.
