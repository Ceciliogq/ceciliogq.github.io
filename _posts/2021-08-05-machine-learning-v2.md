## Types of Learning
  - Supervised: we have a label for the data which tells us the correct solution. E.g.: classificiation (categories), regression (numeric value).
  - Unsupervised: without labels, learn by itself, find structure in the data, tries to group the data and find correlations.
  - Reinforcement learning: learn by trial and error, not by example, it is free to experiment.

## Data
  - Categorical: the prediction you want to get. Mutually excusive. E.g.: cat, dog, ...; male, female.
  - Ordinal: categories that have an order: poor, satisfactory, good, excellent,
  - Numeric
