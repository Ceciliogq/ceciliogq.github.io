title: 'Towards the routine use of subdominant harmonics in gravitational-wave inference: Reanalysis of GW190412 with generation X waveform models'
excerpt: >- 
  We reanalyze the gravitational-wave event GW190412 with state-of-the-art phenomenological waveform models. This event, which has been associated with a black hole merger, is interesting due to the significant contribution from subdominant harmonics.
