I am a Physics Doctor from [Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada), Spain. I obtained my Ph.D from the University of Balearic Islands under the supervision of Profs. Sascha Husa and Alicia Sintes. I worked in the development of computationally efficient models which describe the subdominant modes content of the inspiral-merger-ringdown signal emitted by the fusion of binaries black holes.

These models belong to the IMRPhenomX waveform family, created to address the challenges of the exceptional events to be detected during the third observation period. They are currently being used by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration to obtain accurate information about the properties of the emitting source.

I am interested in:
- Accurate waveform modelling
- Computational parallelization, GPUs
- Data analysis, machine learning, AI
- Software development, open source

Among my hobbies, you can find me at the gym, playing the guitar, reading History or learning about anything related with coding.
